    "1 What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "ANS- \n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a way to structure and organize complex software systems by modeling them as a collection of objects that interact with each other. OOP aims to promote code reusability, maintainability, and scalability by organizing code into modular units called objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key principles of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation allows objects to hide their internal state and provide a controlled interface for interacting with that state. Inheritance enables the creation of new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their properties and behaviors. Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type, providing flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "By encapsulating data and behavior within objects, OOP promotes the concept of modular and reusable code. This facilitates easier code maintenance, as changes made to one object do not necessarily affect other parts of the system. OOP also supports the concept of code organization through classes, which serve as blueprints for creating objects with similar characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the primary goal of OOP is to improve the structure, flexibility, and maintainability of software systems by modeling them as collections of interacting objects, thus making it easier to develop, understand, and modify complex applications."

    "In Python, an object is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming. It is a specific instance of a class, which serves as a blueprint for creating objects. In simpler terms, an object is a container that holds both data (attributes or properties) and behaviors (methods or functions) related to a particular concept or entity.\n",
